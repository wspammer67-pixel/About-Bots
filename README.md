# 📄 Read All TXT Files — Discord Bot Information

This folder contains important **.txt files** used by the Discord bot.
These files store configuration, logs, and data that the bot reads while running.

---

## 📁 What’s in this folder?

All `.txt` files here are **read by the bot automatically** to control behavior, permissions, or saved data.

Examples may include:

* Command logs
* User data
* Configuration values
* System messages
* Moderation records

> ⚠️ Do not delete or rename these files unless you know what you’re doing.
> The bot depends on them to function correctly.

## 🧠 How the Bot Uses These Files

The bot will:

1. Open these `.txt` files when it starts
2. Read data from them during commands
3. Update them when actions happen in the server

---

## 🛠 For Developers

If you are editing or modifying the bot:

* Make sure file names stay the same
* Keep the formatting inside the files consistent
* Use UTF-8 encoding when editing

---

## 📌 Notes

* These files act as a **lightweight database** for the bot
* They allow the bot to save information without needing a full database setup
